# core

## dissector tables:
- should be able to add and remove entries
- - allows reconfiguring dissection process as the user would like
- could be a type alias or their own type
- update: kind've done?

## pstruct
- "protocol struct"
- idea is that one can generalize all parts of protocol definitions
- mark fields as appropriate like
`
#[derive(Protocol)]
pub struct MyProto<'a> {
    #[field(formatter=format_ip_addr)]
    pub src_addr: BytesField<4>,
    #[field(formatter=format_ip_addr)]
    pub dst_addr: BytesField<4>,
}
`
pstruct should add <field>, set_<field>, and with_<field> functions for each
protocol field marked #[field(...)]

pstruct fields should also have left-handed alignment by default, but could also have something
like #[field(align=(u32, "right"))] so that the field aligns to the nearest u32 index on the right.

padding should be supported.

fields should be optional, such that they are activated based on a callback:
    #[field(activate=has_options)]
    pub ipv4_options: RepeatedField<


# protocols:
## ipv4:
- Ipv4 options parsing
- rename from "ip" to "ipv4"

## ipv6:
- Finish parsing fields
- Need to add options for this (if it has them)

## tcp:
- Need to parse options on this one, too.

## arp:
- General support

## dns:
- super common. should support this.

## ssh:
- 

## ftp:
-

## dhcp
-
